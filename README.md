# FOCA
This was a website created with the purpose of creating and managing custom groups of football teams. Data on the football teams was acquired through the football-data.org WEB API. This project has two components, the front-end made with JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS and Handlebars and the back-end made with Node.js, Express.js and ElasticSearch.
